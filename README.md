## Introduction

An emacs command that is clone of "ci" in vim.  
You can use `ci"`, `ci(`, `ciw` and so on with `Ctrl-c, i`.    
Also you can copy them with `Ctrl-c, o` instead of `Ctrl-c, i`.  
This is standalone package and you can probably use on any mode.

I decided to remove `cit` on master branch, because it's too huge.  
I'm not going to add `cit` againg for now.  
Other command is still available and I think it's almost complete.  

## Comapision with others

 - Similar to the behavior of vim.
 - Possible to kill the nested parentheses if cursor is inside.
 - No dependencies.
 - Works in any mode.


## Installation

Download ci.el somewhere.  
For example:

	cd ~/.emacs.d/elisp/
	git clone https://github.com/cs14095/ciel.el
	
or download from melpa.

	M-x package-install ciel

Then add the following in your .emacs file:

	(setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/elisp/ciel.el" load-path))
	(require 'ciel)
	(global-set-key "\C-ci" 'ciel-ci)
	(global-set-key "\C-co" 'ciel-co)
	
or you installed by melpa, then just add

	(global-set-key "\C-ci" 'ciel-ci)
	(global-set-key "\C-co" 'ciel-co)
	
additionaly you want to bind spacific command, then add

	(global-set-key "favorite key" 'ciel-kill-a-word)
	(global-set-key "favorite key" 'ciel-copy-a-word)
	(global-set-key "favorite key" '(lambda ()
										(interactive) 
										(ciel-kill-region-quote "favorite quote")
	(global-set-key "favorite key" '(lambda ()
										(interactive)
										(ciel-kill-region-paren "favorite parentheses")
	
## Usage

Press `Ctrl-c, i` or `Ctrl-c, o` and enter the available character.  
See example or vim usage for more information.  


## Example

	Ctrl-c, i, w => kill a word  
	Ctrl-c, i, ' => kill inside ''
	Ctrl-c, i, " => kill inside ""  
	Ctrl-c, i, ` => kill inside ``  
	Ctrl-c, i, [()] => kill inside ()  
	Ctrl-c, i, [{}] => kill inside {}  
	Ctrl-c, i, [<>] => kill inside <>  
	Ctrl-c, i, [[]] => kill inside []  
	
	Ctrl-c, o, w => copy a word  
	Ctrl-c, o, ' => copy inside ''
	Ctrl-c, o, " => copy inside ""  
	Ctrl-c, o, ` => copy inside ``  
	Ctrl-c, o, [()] => copy inside ()  
	Ctrl-c, o, [{}] => copy inside {}  
	Ctrl-c, o, [<>] => copy inside <>  
	Ctrl-c, o, [[]] => copy inside []  

You can also kill the nested parentheses as you can see.
